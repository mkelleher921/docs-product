# Our Mission

### Why do ‘we do what we do’ at ATTN:?

Our goal as product managers is to not just build, but to create true value in the form of scalable productization in different areas within ATTN:. Our product team contributes to both bottom line and top line initiatives, and each product manager is responsible for the respective areas’ goals and success. 

We work together, collaborate with internal and external teams, and always believe the **problems we solve are more valuable than the features we build.** 

We do not build to build. We build to solve problems with measurable goals attached. Value is in what people use, not what we create! 

### Our 2018/2019 Vision

We aim to embrace the state of media and how it is changing. ATTN: is growing quickly, and we strive to create scalable technology to support a lean team and maximize revenue opportunities moving forward. Each product area rolls up to the overall goals of ATTN: as a company:
* Revenue diversification and growth through data tools and data democratization
* Creative tools to increase productivity
* Campaign supported immersive experiences to create/support sales initiatives and introduce new revenue opportunities
