# Communication

Product Managers are accountable to communication standards with both internal teams and external stakeholders that may exceed other areas of P&E. As the owners of our areas, it is very important for us to maintain healthy communication channels where our products are being developed and used. It is important for us to proactively seek information to find needed product improvements, as well as advocate for technology and products that bring us closer to our area’s respective goals. 

## With Product Designers

Product Managers and Product Designers are closely aligned at ATTN:, and we aim to welcome their feedback and expertise wherever possible. When bringing an initial specification to the Product Design team, there are a few standards we abide to: 

**Design Brainstorm/Early product feedback:**

This type of meeting should be focused on feedback from the Product Design team and to gather information from the initial product specification put together by the PM. It also may be used to supplement requirements gathering/write a finalized specification. The PM may not have a full spec at this stage, but should have general components and goals for the product before meeting with Product Design. 

This meeting can take many forms based on the product being brainstormed:

* Storyboarding/story mapping sessions
* User pathway brainstorm sessions
* Product analysis review and team discussion
* Specification review and revisions based on PD’s feedback

Product manager’s goal for this meeting is to have a prioritized list of user stories/ an idea of the users stories and requirements from PD to be spec’d out in the product specification for final review
