# Communication

Product Managers are accountable to communication standards with both internal teams and external stakeholders that may exceed other areas of P&E. As the owners of our areas, it is very important for us to maintain healthy communication channels where our products are being developed and used. It is important for us to proactively seek information to find needed product improvements, as well as advocate for technology and products that bring us closer to our area’s respective goals. 

PMs at ATTN: always put empathy first. We understand that all teams have their own goals and needs… our job is to collaboratively support these goals as well as prioritize the order in which we work on products to support the overall company goals of ATTN: 

We will always accept and be open to feedback wherever possible. Feedback is always good feedback… and we want an open door policy for all stakeholders and teams to get feedback early and often

## With Product Designers

Product Managers and Product Designers are closely aligned at ATTN:, and we aim to welcome their feedback and expertise wherever possible. When bringing an initial specification to the Product Design team, there are a few standards we abide to: 

**Design Brainstorm/Early product feedback:**

This type of meeting should be focused on feedback from the Product Design team and to gather information from the initial product specification put together by the PM. It also may be used to supplement requirements gathering/write a finalized specification. The PM may not have a full spec at this stage, but should have general components and goals for the product before meeting with Product Design. 

This meeting can take many forms based on the product being brainstormed:

* Storyboarding/story mapping sessions
* User pathway brainstorm sessions
* Product analysis review and team discussion
* Specification review and revisions based on PD’s feedback

Product manager’s goal for this meeting is to have a prioritized list of user stories/ an idea of the users stories and requirements from PD to be spec’d out in the product specification for final review

**Product Specification Final Review:**

The goal of this meeting is to review a finalized product spec created by the PM. As in all build processes, things come up, and revisions may still need to be made after things are finalized… but the goal is to review the full product requirements and goals in heavy detail for what needs to be built. 

This meeting serves as review of all the requirements gathering sessions and necessary brainstorms for the product build. No one on the PD team should be surprised by anything in this meeting! 

Design runs on 1 week sprints, and starts their sprint every Monday, so spec reviews should be timed with that in mind in case there needs to be tasks added to their upcoming sprint.

Product manager's goals for this meeting:

*  Have sign off from Design on what needs to be designed, as well as confirmation of when we can estimate having designs finalized for handoff to Engineering. 

* Have a fully prioritized list of user stories for the product being spec’d to add to the product area’s Trello backlog for the technical coordinator to estimate/review with Engineering to progress to Sprint Estimation. 

## With Engineers

Product Managers are responsible for clear communication with Engineering for planning and prioritization. PMs at ATTN: are generally responsible for the ‘what’ and the ‘why’ in regards to a product, while Engineering is responsible for filling in gaps for the ‘how’ and the ‘when’. PMs are accountable for this from ideation to launch, and we are responsible for getting engineering involved as early as possible to discover any unknowns for prioritization.  

**Tech Brainstorms:**

Product managers should come as prepared as possible. PMs are responsible for product requirements gathering and stakeholder/business requirements gathering before having a technical brainstorm, and should use the technical brainstorms to add or revise the possible product outcomes for the requirements gathered.

Technical brainstorms should be used in an informal manner, and should always start with the technical lead in the area the product is for. 

* Our current tech lead for all product areas is Colby Palmer, Director of Engineering
* PM/Technical coordinator should reach out to Colby before setting the meeting and ask which engineers should be added to the brainstorm before setting the meeting.

The product manager’s goal for this meeting is to gather needed technical investigations, additional details for requirements, and begin to create their respective Trello cards for the specification. These tasks should be broken down by the engineering team from each brainstorm until the final specification can be reviewed and agreed upon by both teams. 

**Product Specification Review:**

The goal of this meeting is to review a finalized product spec created by the PM. As in all build processes, things come up, and revisions may still need to be made… but the goal is to agree on full product requirements and goals in heavy detail for what needs to be built. 

This specification should be in a finalized version with details included from the previous team brainstorms and technical investigations.

Product manager’s goal for this meeting is to have sign off from Engineering on what needs to be built, as well as confirmation of how it will be built and a ballpark estimation for when. 

## With Stakeholders

Requirements gathering is used to gather team stakeholder goals and non negotiables for each product on the PM’s product area roadmap

PM is responsible for managing each stakeholder’s requirements as well as expectations for final product features based on the best fit from all stakeholders involved

These should be used where needed, but should always have accountable goals attached

PMs can structure this meeting however they see fit, but PM’s goal for this meeting should be to gather needed info to put together the ‘What’ and the ‘Why’, and also core components for each product they build

PMs should have quarterly meetings that can be structured however the PM sees fit with their highest level area’s stakeholders to ensure the product area encompasses each team’s goals and needs for the business

The goal of this meeting is to get accountable sign off on the upcoming products in the area’s pipeline, and also give stakeholders visibility to how each product supports or does not support their team’s goals
