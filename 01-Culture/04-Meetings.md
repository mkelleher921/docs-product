# Meetings

### Sprint Grooming

Sprint grooming is a dedicated time for Engineering and Product to discuss, breakdown cards that are too large, and prioritize/prepare the the work going into the upcoming sprint.

* Product Managers should groom, prioritize, and fill out all cards they want completed in the next sprint by sprint grooming. If the cards are not complete from previous brainstorms and investigations, the PM should assume that work is not going to completed, and they will have to finish the cards details to be planned for a future sprint

Sprint grooming should not surface surprises in the form of work that engineering is not aware of. If the Product Managers have done their due diligence and completed the required meetings previous to grooming, all teams should be on the same page about what needs to be finished

* If this is not the case, the product’s cards should go back into planning to get everyone on the same page and planned for a future sprint.

Product manager’s goal for this meeting is to have a fully prioritized product area backlog for the technical coordinator to estimate with Engineering in Sprint Estimation. 

### Sprint Planning/Estimation

Sprint planning is for estimating and assigning the groomed backlog from sprint grooming.

Product Managers are not required to attend this meeting, the Technical Coordinator owns this for the PMs. 

If the PM can make this meeting, it is **highly** encouraged to support any last minute questions or needed feedback from Engineering

Product Team’s goal from this meeting is estimated cards from the backlog planned to be completed in the next sprint

Technical project coordinator will send any needed details to each PM in regards to their product area and planned trello cards

Goal of this meeting is to have a fully estimated sprint for engineering to work on, as well as a clear understanding of the sprint goals and what should be shipped

### Sprint Retros

Product Managers attend all sprint retros. This meeting is designed to review completed work from the finished sprint, and discuss any blockers or items that were not completed.

Sprint Retros also serve as an opportunity for all team members to voice their praises and concerns.

This is a safe space, and we trust each other to give constructive feedback where needed. This meeting is designed to allow all team members to discuss what's necessary for the entire team to improve for the next sprint.

PM’s goal for this meeting is to give feedback where needed to improve product prioritization and task prioritization for the next sprint.

PM should also make a final sign off for what is shippable in each sprint.

### Project Tracker

Product team has an organized timeline that is used to manage HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW priority products that are in the pipeline. Each week, the teams meets to review these priorities and discuss all progress and any blockers they may have to meet the deadline

Team lead for Eng. also joins this meeting for the first part to review the tracker with the team. It is important for the Eng. lead to be present so they can also give feedback if the deadline for the product is unrealistic based on the previous estimations. Eng. lead can also fill in any info to the CTO outside of the PM’s visibility. 

This project tracker is also viewed by the management team. It helps the management team understand where each product area’s highest priority items are also which ones are not. 

The tracker is owned by the Technical Coordinator, and reflects progress based on the Trello boards that they also manage. They are the first line of defense to have visibility to any project that may be off track. 

You can view/update your product area items on the [project tracker here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Project-Tracker-9SUaW4bfBfHAJceJJlofd).

### Management Syncs

Managements syncs are monthly meetings that happen on the first Monday of every month.

These syncs are 30 min in length and offer the product team an opportunity to align with the executive team on product priorities, business goals, and present product items that were shipped in the previous month. 

Product lead tends to own the presentation/deck that the team comes with every meeting, and finalizes all info for the roadmap, product planning, and product launches that happened in the previous month before the meeting.

Product lead will meet with Design/Eng lead to fill in all needed info the week prior to the meeting, and also will send the presentation out to the team before the meeting to get any needed revisions.

Product Team’s goals for this meeting:
* Get feedback from the executive team on products in the pipeline
* Have accountable feedback on changes that are needed for product/product area directions
* Discuss any large blockers that are keeping product from doing their roles effectively in the larger ATTN: organization
