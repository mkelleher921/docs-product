# Communication

As a member of the P&E team, you can find overall best communication practices and tools in the [P&E Wiki](https://github.com/attn/docs-p-e/blob/master/01-Culture/02-Communication.md). Collaboration and transparency with team members will take you far!

### Stakeholder Management

Product managers are responsible for communicating with company stakeholders and the co-founders to align on overall goals of their respective product areas that support the company mission. 

You should come away with these meetings with the following info: 

* Goals (short-term and long-term)
* Blockers (if anything is causing a delay or interference in their day-to-day)
* Points of contact on stakeholder's team
* Workflows
* Non-negotiables of ideal products
