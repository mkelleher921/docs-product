# Product Manager Process

### It's my first day...

1. Set up meetings with every department head that’s relevant to your product area to discover their goals (both short and long term), current problems/blockers they face in your product area, align, understand workflows 

2. Set up meetings with the founders to understand company goals, mission, and align

3. Meet with P&E members to understand the technical infrastructure of the business

4. Meet with CTO to present findings from meetings and propose initial product for roadmap, after CTO approves, start requirements gathering

5. Perform market/competitor analysis and decide what’s best for the company

6. Bring research to stakeholders to propose/discuss non-negotiables 

7. Begin writing [product specification](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Product-Spec-Template-UQDLOocH6k2aNTWmuARnC) and [project summary](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Project-Summary-Template-Jh3aOkxldv0apDn2bsXgY).

Follow the steps in the product workflow. (include Sketch link here)
